#Dependency Injection
######—by Brad Wilson
##SOFTWARE DESIGN PATTERNS
To understand what dependency injection is and how you can apply it to MVC applications,
you need to understand software design patterns. A software design pattern is used to formalize the description of a problem and a solution to that problem, so that developers can use the
pattern to simplify the identifcation and communication of common problems and solutions.
The design pattern isn’t necessarily to claim the invention of something new or novel, but
rather exists to give a formal name and defnition from common practices in the industry.
When you read about a design pattern, you might recognize it from solutions you’ve used in
particular problems in the past.
##Design Pattern: Dependency Injection
The dependency injection (DI) pattern is another form of the inversion of control pattern, wherein
there is no intermediary object like the service locator. Instead, components are written in a way
that allows their dependencies to be stated explicitly, usually by way of constructor parameters or
property setters.
Developers who choose dependency injection over service location are often making a conscious
decision to choose transparency of requirements over opacity. Choosing the transparency of dependency injection also has signifcant advantages during unit testing, as discussed in the next chapter.
Constructor Injection
The most common form of dependency injection is called constructor injection. This technique
involves creating a constructor for your class that expresses all of its dependencies explicitly (as
opposed to the previous service location examples, where your constructor took the service locator
as its only constructor parameter).
Now take a look at what NotificationSystem would look like if designed to support constructor
injection:
--
public class NotificationSystem
{
private IMessagingService svc;
public NotificationSystem(IMessagingService service)
{
this.svc = service;
}
public void InterestingEventHappened()
{
svc.SendMessage();
}
}
